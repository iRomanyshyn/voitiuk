## Anna Voitiuk

Hello and welcome to my personal website.

I am a Ukrainian printmaker and graphic artist. In my work, I focus on monochrome, highly detailed print techniques and visual storytelling that combines symbolic imagery, animals, and surreal narrative elements.

### Artist statement

In my artistic practice, I explore fragility, memory, and resilience. I am interested in how a printed image can hold both precision and emotion at the same time. Through graphic structure and detail, I build visual worlds that feel intimate, poetic, and slightly unsettling.

### Name transliteration

The generally correct transliteration of my surname is **Voitiuk**.  
The variant **Vojtiuk** has the same pronunciation and is also used in some publications.

### Selected exhibitions and presentations

My work is presented in graphic art and exlibris contexts, including gallery projects and community-based initiatives.
